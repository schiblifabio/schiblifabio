- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @schiblifabio
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in traveling around the world and explore new spots. When the weather is fine and the conditions are good I like to go kitesurfing or I go up in the mountains and hit the slopes with my snowboard :).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying economy-IT in Zurich, Switzerland. Concerning coding I am at the beginner level for the object orientaded programming and I began with first small projects. I'm always curious about learning new things and expanding my knowledge.
- ðŸ“« For questions and other requests you can easily reach me via mail: fabio.schibli@gmail.com
